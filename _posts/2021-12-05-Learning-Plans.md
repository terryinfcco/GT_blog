So I'm suddenly pretty happy with Jekyll and what I've got set up in this real
thing directory. So I'm going to work on both the Udemy Django course and I think
Net Ninja's stuff. But I've got both the Academind and the Colt Steele web courses
on Udemy also.

I want to set up my categories page so that it's got all the preset categories pages
that I might need.

I looked at and tried to follow a video about running Django on a Ubuntu server and
I'm a little disappointed in that. So I think it's Academind 100 Days Web Developement
course for me right now.
