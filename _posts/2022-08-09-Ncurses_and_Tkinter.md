I'm thinking that I should write a todo app in ncurses and then if I want convert it to tkinter. That way I can get some of the stuff I'm uncomfortable with like file I/O and how to store the data out of the way in a simpler environment.

I think I'll fool around with a csv file, maybe item number, title, and notes (for stuff like progress, hurdles I run into, etc.).
