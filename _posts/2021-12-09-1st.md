I'm going to try to restart the Codemy.com Django classes. I think I know how to
create it on a server (probably the pi that houses the Tiddlywiki stuff). Couple of
things I want to do first:

* Backup Tiddlywiki's
* Figure out how to remote into a server with VSCode
* Work on the first really simple Codemy.com Django course.
