Several thoughts while I couldn't sleep last night.

* I could run Django projects on my servers here at home using the development server
pretty easily.
* I'm not sure whatever I developed in Django would be any better or as good as
what I can accomplish with Jekyll, Dokuwiki, Tiddlywiki, MkDocs etc.
* I do think I could get back to things like the Freecell solver and have some fun
with desktop development.
